The aim of project was to classify iris plants into three species. A dataset consisting of details of the iris plants was divided into Training and Test dataset. Machine learning models were build using training dataset. Trained models were then used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. To start with, data was explored, preprocessed and visualized. Machine learning models were then applied to the preprocessed data
